Why matrix multiplication is done the way it is done? Why the cross-product has anything to do with determinant? What does eigen value represent?

__Need to understand linear algebra on a geometric level.__  
Geometric understanding helps us to judge:
- What tools to use to solve specific problems.
- Feel why they work.
- And know how to interpret the results.

And the numeric understanding helps us to carry through the application of these tools.

### Structure of the Lesson

__This lesson will be broken down into four main parts:__

1. __Videos__- emphasizing the world of linear Algebra in a beautiful visual way.  
2. __Theory__- text elaborating on definitions and mathematical calculations, as well as theoretical quizzes. 
3. __Labs__- implementation of the theoretical concepts in code. 
4. __Neural Network intro__- Final lesson putting all the pieces together as we directly connect Linear Algebra to the world of Neural Networks.
