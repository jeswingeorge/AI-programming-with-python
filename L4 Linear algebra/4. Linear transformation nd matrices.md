### Multiplication of Square Matrices
The easiest multiplication to consider is that of two __square matrices__ of the same dimensions nnxnn.

A square matrix is a matrix that has the same number of rows and columns.

if A is an `n × m` matrix and B is an `m × p` matrix, their matrix product AB is an `n × p` matrix, in which the m entries across a row of A are multiplied with the m entries down a column of B and summed to produce an entry of AB. When two linear transformations are represented by matrices, then the matrix product represents the composition of the two transformations.

Since matrices A x B ≠ B x A we say they there are __not commutative__. This is a very interesting observation, as multiplication of scalars is definitely commutative.
