# Mean squared error function

## Log-Loss vs Mean Squared Error
In the previous section, we learnt about the log-loss function. There are many other error functions used for neural networks. Here we will learn the __mean squared error__. As the name says, this one is the mean of the squares of the differences between the predictions and the labels. 

We'll be implementing this in a very effective way using matrix multiplication with NumPy!
