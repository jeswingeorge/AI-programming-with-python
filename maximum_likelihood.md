## Maximum Likelihood

Student with 2 models giving probability of acceptance as: __Model A - 80% and Model B - 55%__. So __best model is the one that gives the probability of the event that happens to us.__ So if we get selected Model A will be better and if student did not get accepted then we can say that the more accurate model is Model B.
